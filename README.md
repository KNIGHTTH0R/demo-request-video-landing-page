# demo-request-video-landing-page
Standard landing pages have marketing copy and a graphic on one side and a long form on the other side of the page. Filling out this form usually sends you some kind of marketing collateral, requests further information, or in our case, requests a demo. Giving a product demo every time someone fills out your landing page may not be logistically feasible so perhaps it's time to think outside of the box.  By creating a demo video you can streamline your sales process, save money, and automate your lead generation initiatives. But where does the demo video go? You still want to capture prospect and lead information so just placing it on your website won't do. That's where this landing page design comes in. Not only does this design and functionality streamline your sales process, you still collect lead data, and you can give thousands of demos a minute without having to pool any internal resources to do so. Enjoy.
